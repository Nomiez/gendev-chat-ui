# CHECK24 GenDev Messenger Challenge
Welcome to my submission for the 4th round of the GenDev Scholarship! üöÄ I'm excited to present my implementation of the CHECK24 Messenger Challenge, building a seamless chat experience for service providers and customers.

## Overview
This messenger application allows users to communicate seamlessly after a service provider sends a quote. The challenge involves creating both the backend and frontend components, providing a robust and enjoyable user experience.

## Stack
Backend: Pythons FastAPI with PostgresDB for data persistence.
Frontend: React.js (Vite) for a responsive and dynamic UI.

## This are the minimal functional requirements I have implemented:
‚úÖ Chat view: the same conversation should be viewable from both perspectives: customer and service provider (they should each have their own site/route, so that hypothetically a service provider on one device is able to chat with the customer on the other device)

‚úÖ Overview over all chats: think about implementing simple(!) chat overviews for both perspectives to click into chats, too.

‚úÖ Persistance: chats are mutable, so they should be persisted in a database/store of your choice and accessible via an unique identifier

‚úÖ Scrolling pagination: the customer/service provider should be able to scroll through a chat (and its history) with a hypothetical length of 10000s of messages per chat (think about Pagination)

‚úÖ Image and PDF attachments: The customer/service provider should be able to send messages with optional attachments like pictures or documents (PDF)

‚úÖ Masking of sensible information: Any contactable data (phone, email, URL) within all messages should be masked as long as the conversation status is "quoted"

‚úÖ Show sent message in chat without refreshing: Messages should appear within the chat as they were sent (without refreshing the page)

‚úÖ Hide message field if rejected state: If a conversation status is "rejected" the message input field should disappear and actions should not be possible any longer

‚úÖ Request customer reviews: Within the chat the service provider should be able to request a review from the customer once they've worked together (feature explicitly explained within our provided datasets)

‚úÖ A quick screencast üé• of your final working app within your GitHub repository (+ optional a link to a live version to check out or an explanation how to start your app on our machines, see "How do I hand in my project?")

## The other ideas:
‚úÖ Unread banner behaviour (highly appreciated)

‚úÖ An extendable/generic message API format (consider whether your API design is also suitable for new product requirements e.g. new message types)

‚úÖ Thumbnail processing (to improve UX)

‚úÖ Live-Updates (Socket/Polling/...) - (in my case SSE)

‚ùå Start the conversation at the scroll offset of the first unread message

‚úÖ Dockerize your system so that anyone can run it on their machine

‚úÖ OpenAPI for backend <-> frontend communication (+ code generation)

## Other implemented ideas:
‚úÖ OAuth2-Integration

üìö Message Reactions

üìö User Search with Keywords from all users

‚úÖ Paginated Chat view

(üìö) On Database Level: Support for Thread Messages

### Explanation
‚úÖ Implemented in Client and Server

üìö Only implemented in Server

‚ùå Not implemented

## How to Run Locally

### Via docker-compose
You can run the application via docker-compose. 
Therefore, you need access to the docker image of the server and client on ghcr.io.
```
docker login ghcr.io
```
Navigate to the project directory and export the following environment variables:
```
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
export SECRET_KEY=...
export TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES
```
After that you can run:
```
docker-compose up
```

### For development
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.

#### For the server

‚ùóÔ∏è Do this first if you do not have generated the client

Navigate to '/server' and export/put the following env variable in an .env file:
```
DATABASE_HOSTNAME=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_PASSWORD=...
DATABASE_NAME=gendev_db
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
SECRET_KEY=...
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1000
```
If you have no running db you could also export the following env variable:
```
export SKIP_DB_CONNECTION=True
```
Afterwards, run the following command to generate the client:
```
python extract-openapi.py app.main:app
```
Before installing the requirements, think about creating a virtual environment.
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment. Afterwards, install the requirements and run the server.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

#### For the client

Navigate to '/client' and put the following env variable in an .env file:
```
VITE_PROXY_API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8000
```
Afterwards, install the requirements and run the server.
```
yarn install
```
```
yarn run generateAPI
```
```
yarn run dev
```
